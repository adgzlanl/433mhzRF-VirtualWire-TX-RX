   AUTHOR:  Andrew Davies

This is an example of how to use the 433MHz wireless reciever module
(HCMODU0007) which is the Rx part of the tranmitter and reciver module pair.
This example makes use of the VirtualWire library written by Mike McCauley.
This sketch in intended to be used with the Tx example code to recive analogue
input data sent from the transmitting Arduino. The received data is then output
to the UART.

Rx MODULE CONNECTIONS:

PIN  DESCRIPTION      ARDUINO PIN
1    GND              GND
2    RX DATA          D2
3    RX DATA          N/A
4    VCC (5V)         VCC
